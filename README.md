👋 Hi, I’m @yves

👀 I’m into Python 🐍, Django 🦄, .NET Core ⚙️, Node.js 🌲, and PHP/Laravel 🏃💨

💻 Basically, if it compiles (or sometimes even when it doesn’t) — I’ll code it.

⚡ Fun fact: My bug-to-feature conversion rate is 100%.

🛠 Favorite debugging tool: print("why??")

🧩 Current mission: Turning coffee ☕ into production-ready code (and occasionally into infinite loops).

📫 You can find me here: ngahsevy@gmail.com
